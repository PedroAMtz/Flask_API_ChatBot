**Project Description** :scroll:

This project aims to build a Flask API based on openai gpt model for completion. The objective is to develop a chatbot application that will assist medical professionals during clinical phases of diabetes mellitus diagnosis.
The gpt model is intended to read some system specifications (prompt engineering) and have some relevant information as a source of the responses to the user.

**Project Phases** :rocket:

**Phase 1:** In the first phase we explore the openai api functionality, structuring some functions to obtain text completion using some of the OpenAI models specialized for that task. This phase consists on building the model functionality, giving some context to the system and validating the type of response.

**Phase 2:** Build a Flask web application which will inherit the model functionality defined in the previous phase. The Flask API should had a GET method and POST method to request the user input and follow the chatbot function.

**Phase 3:** Test the API using some external tools like postman or insomnia.

**Phase 4 (Optional):** Build some nice frontend for the web application.
